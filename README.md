<details>

Simple version:

Version w/ custom text for expand/collapse:

![](img-readme/details2.png)

You can select an existing section, and it will be wrapped in `<details>`.

![](img-readme/details4.png)

And by the way, this is how it's rendered. `<details>` is a standard HTML tag; it's not our invention. You can use it anywhere in HTML and/or Markdown. In other programs as well, e.g. GitHub, etc. We use this tag even for this `README.md` that you are currently reading ðŸ™‚.

### Add questions

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Fig 1</td>
        <td>Fig 2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>

![](img-readme/questions1.png)
        </td>

        </td>

In our company we leverage this plugin and:
* we have a scheduled task (written in TS / [deno](https://deno.com/))
* that uses the API to check if the questions are answered
* and if not, it sends reminders.

### Answer to questions

## Actions to trigger when fields are changed

<details>

In the plugin's settings, you can set the **actions** using a JSON, such as:

![](img-readme/actions_settings.png)

Before status changes:

![](img-readme/actions_issue_before_field_reset.png)

WHEN field **Status** is changed from **To review** to another value, THEN the field **Security** will be reset to its default value:

![](img-readme/actions_issue_after_field_reset.png)

Available list of triggers: ["when-changed-from"] <br>
Available list of actions: ["reset-field"]

*NOTE:* More triggers and actions will be added in the future, so stay tuned.
